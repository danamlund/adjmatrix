  <h3>What</h3>
  <p>The big matrix is an 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">Adjacency
    matrix</a>, a representation of a graph. If row 2 and column 4 is
    colored, that means there exists an edge from node #2 to node
    #4.</p>
  <p>This adjacency matrix was generated
  using <a href="http://danamlund.dk/adjmatrix">Adjacency matrix code visualizer</a>.</p>

  <h3>Why</h3>
  <p>The adjacency matrix give you an overview over connections in
  your graph. These examples are about connections between classes in
  a java code-base. Some interesting revelations this overview can
  give are:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>See how connected your packages are</dt>
    <dd>Sort and color by <em>Package</em>. A perfect code base will
    have box shapes along the diagonal in the same color, and not many
    points above or next to this box. A box of the same color shows
    that classes within a package uses each other. Having few points
    above or next to the box means that other packages do not used by
    other packages. A Tools packages would have many points above and
    below it because it is being used by all classes.</dd>

    <dt>Highlight groups of highly connected classes</dt>
    <dd>Sort by <em>Similarity</em> and color
    by <em>Package</em>. This groups together classes that are highly
    connected to each other and not highly connected to others,
    largest groups are at the top left. You should see boxes along the
    diagonal. If a box has two colors, then two packages are heavily
    connected. If there are two boxes with the same color, then that
    package should perhaps be split into two packages.</dd>

    <dt>Identify tools classes</dt>
    <dd>Sort by <em>Used</em>. The most used classes are near the top
    left. If you see colors in the full height at the left part you
    have classes that are heavily used from all your classes. If you
    see many colors in the whole the matrix, then all classes use all
    other classes.</dd>

    <dt>Identify God classes</dt>
    <dd>Sort by <em>Uses</em>. The classes that use the use the most
    classes are near the top left.</dd>

    <dt>Find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Bacon</a></dt>
    <dd>Find one or a few classes by zooming or filtering. The click
    the <em>Add uses</em> or <em>Add used by</em> buttons to show all
    classes that uses or are used by your starting classes. See how
    few clicks it takes to connect all your classes from different
    start classes.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>How</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Zoom to rectangle</dt>
    <dd>You can click-drag a rectangle to zoom in to a part of the
    matrix. But zooming is weird in a NxN matrix. Zooming to a
    rectangle shows all rows overlapping the height of the rectangle,
    and all columns overlapping the width of the rectangle. Because of
    this, zooming in areas away from the diagonal give weird
    results.</dd>

    <dt>Mouse-wheel zoom</dt>
    <dd>You can also use the mouse-wheel to zoom in or out around your
    mouse pointer. Again, zooming around areas away from the diagonal
    give weird results.</dd>

    <dt>Group by</dt>
    <dd>Switches to a new graph where the nodes have been merged. Two
    merged nodes are connected when any node in the un-merged nodes
    are connected.</dd>

    <dt>Filter</dt>
    <dd>Show just the classes that contains your filter text.</dd>

    <dt>Add uses</dt>
    <dd>Add all classes that uses one of the currently showing
    classes. This button does nothing when showing all classes.</dd>

    <dt>Add used</dt>
    <dd>Add all classes that are used by one of the currently showing
    classes. This button does nothing when showing all classes.</dd>

    <dt>Order by:</dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Package</em>: Order nodes by their packages.</li>
        <li><em>Name</em>: Order nodes by their names.</li>
        <li><em>Connections</em>: Order nodes by the number of nodes
          they use plus the number of nodes are used by them. Most
          connected nodes are near the top left.</li>
        <li><em>Used</em>: Order nodes by the number of nodes that are
          used by them.</li>
        <li><em>Uses</em>: Order nodes by the number of nodes they
          use.</li>
        <li><em>Similarity</em>: Attempts to make groups of nodes that
          are highly connected to each other and not very connected to
          other nodes. The largest group is near the top left.</li>
        <li><em>jar</em>: Order nodes by which jar they come from.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Color by:</dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Package</em>: Give nodes in the same package the same
          color.</li>
        <li><em>Name</em>: Give nodes a distinct color.</li>
        <li><em>Connections</em>: Color nodes based on number of nodes
          they use plus the number of nodes are used by them. Most
          connected nodes are blue, least connected nodes are
          black.</li>
        <li><em>jar</em>: Give nodes in the same jar the same
          color.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Pixel size</dt>
    <dd>A large pixel size draws nodes as big circles that are
    transparent. The smallest pixel size draws nodes as pixels. Note:
    large pixel sizes can get very laggy on large graphs.</dd>

    <dt>Showing current/maximum classes (Reset)</dt>
    <dd>Tell you how many nodes are currently shown versus how many
    nodes are in the graph. <em>Reset</em> clears filters and zooms
    all the way out.</dd>

    <dt>Populate table, Clear table</dt>
    <dd><em>Populate table</em> creates a table of up to 1000 of the
    nodes currently shown. <em>Clear table</em> remove the created
    table.</dd>
